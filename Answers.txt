3.
    b. For both the case with only floats in the baskets and the case with multiple data types, the compression factor rises significantly as the basket size increases

    c. The benchmarks tell us that when the compression factor is higher the write time is lower

Day 2:

1. The ReadExampleElectron script can be easily modified to read back the new float decoration, however the long double decoration I was unable to read back.
